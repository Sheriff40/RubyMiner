Description:
    Explain the generator

    Step 1:

       Add the following code in the models, where you want to have notification

         Example: (I want to send notification to all the users in the system, when an event is created)

         after_create :send_notification

         def send_notification
            # For creating a notice after an event is created
            @notice = Notice.create!(title: "A new Event has been created", url: "/events")

            # After the notice has been created sending it as nofitications
            # to all the users in the system
            @notice.users = User.find(User.all.ids)
         end
    Step 2:
      Include header in your dashboard layout page
      = render("/layouts/header")

Example:
    rails generate dashboard_base_generator Thing

    This will create:
        what/will/it/create
