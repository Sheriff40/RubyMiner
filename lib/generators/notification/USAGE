    Explain the generator

    Step 1:
        resources :notices, only: :index
        resources :user_notices, only: :update

    Step 2:
        In user.rb add
          has_many :user_notices, dependent: :destroy
          has_many :notices, through: :user_notices
    Step 3:

       Add the following code in the models, where you want to have notification

         Example: (I want to send notification to all the users in the system, when an event is created)

         after_create :send_notification

         def send_notification
            # For creating a notice after an event is created
            @notice = Notice.create!(title: "A new Event has been created", url: "/events")

            # After the notice has been created sending it as nofitications
            # to all the users in the system
            @notice.users = User.find(User.all.ids)
         end
    Step 4:
      Add in application.js
        require("./notification")

Example:
    rails generate dashboard_base_generator Thing

    This will create:
        what/will/it/create
